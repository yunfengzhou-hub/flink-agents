/**
 * Owns the durable-execution side of {@link ActionExecutionOperator}: the optional {@link
 * ActionStateStore}, the recovery-marker operator state, the per-checkpoint sequence-number map,
 * and the per-{@link ActionTask} {@link RunnerContextImpl.DurableExecutionContext} map.
 *
 * <p>Durable mode is optional. If no {@link ActionStateStore} is configured (and none is
 * pre-injected via the constructor), all {@code maybe*} methods are no-ops and {@link
 * #hasDurableStore()} returns {@code false}. This lets the operator stay agnostic of whether
 * durable execution is enabled.
 *
 * <p>Lifecycle: instantiated in the operator constructor. {@link
 * #maybeInitActionStateStore(AgentConfiguration, int)} runs from BOTH the operator's {@code
 * initializeState()} and {@code open()} — recovery requires the store to be configured before
 * {@link #handleRecovery(OperatorStateBackend, IntPredicate)} reads from it, and the {@code open()}
 * call ensures the store is also available on the normal (non-recovery) path. The method creates a
 * default Kafka-backed store when one was not pre-injected, and is idempotent on the second call.
 * {@link #handleRecovery(OperatorStateBackend, IntPredicate)} runs from the operator's {@code
 * initializeState()} during recovery. {@link #initRecoveryMarkerState(OperatorStateBackend)} runs
 * from the operator's {@code open()}. {@link #close()} closes the underlying store.
 *
 * <p>Design constraint: package-private; no manager-to-manager held references. Cross-cutting data
 * flows via method parameters. In particular, {@link
 * ActionTaskContextManager#transferContexts(ActionTask, ActionTask, DurableExecutionManager)}
 * accepts this manager as a parameter so that the durable-context map can stay encapsulated here.
