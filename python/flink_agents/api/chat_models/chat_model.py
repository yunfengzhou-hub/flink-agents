    Inherits from ``str`` so the value survives the JSON-carried bridge to Java.
    Java serializes this enum as its *name* ("NATIVE") while the value here is
    lowercase, so ``_missing_`` accepts either form in any case — matching the
    case-insensitive resolver on the Java side.

    Attributes:
    ----------
    AUTO : str
        Use the provider's native structured-output API when the effective model is
        capable of it, and fall back to prompt engineering otherwise. The default.
    NATIVE : str
        Always use the provider's native structured-output API, without consulting
        the capability predicate.
    PROMPT : str
        Never use the provider's native structured-output API; rely on prompt
        engineering alone. Matches the behavior of connections that have no native
        translation.

            The schema the response should conform to, or ``None`` for an
            unconstrained response. This is framework-level execution metadata, and
            every implementation must declare it as a named parameter rather than let
            it fall into ``**kwargs``: ``**kwargs`` is forwarded to the provider SDK,
            so a schema landing there would reach the request body.

            An ``OutputSchema`` wraps either a ``BaseModel`` subclass or a
            ``RowTypeInfo``. No implementation translates a ``RowTypeInfo`` natively,
            and what follows differs by implementation: one that translates a
            ``BaseModel`` natively skips the ``RowTypeInfo`` and leaves the request
            unchanged, so the caller keeps the prompt-engineering fallback; one with
            no native translation at all rejects it, as described below. The skip is a
            deliberate, permanent fallback, not a translation still to be written.

            A ``BaseModel`` subclass is refused with a ``TypeError`` naming the schema
            class and chaining the underlying error as its cause, both when it has no
            JSON Schema at all and when it has one that this provider's renderer will
            not accept. The second outcome is per-provider: a model with an untyped
            member renders under Pydantic, and one provider's renderer takes it while
            another refuses it. Neither is raised unless the request was going to
            carry a native schema, since an implementation renders only once it has
            decided to send one — so an unrenderable schema reports nothing when the
            effective model is not one the implementation calls natively capable, or
            when some other condition has already ruled the native branch out.

            A ``BaseModel`` subclass that renders but declares no fields is sent as
            rendered, leaving the receiving provider to accept or refuse it.

            An implementation with no native structured-output translation at all is a
            separate case, not the ``RowTypeInfo`` skip above: it rejects *every*
            non-``None`` schema, ``RowTypeInfo`` included, via
            ``_reject_unsupported_output_schema``, because it could otherwise only
            drop the schema silently. A caller that wants the prompt-engineering
            fallback from such an implementation must pass ``None``.
